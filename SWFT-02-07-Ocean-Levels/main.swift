//  Assuming the ocean's level is currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year, write a program that displays:
//  1. The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will be in 5 years.
//  2. The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will be in 7 years.
//  3. The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will be in 10 years.
